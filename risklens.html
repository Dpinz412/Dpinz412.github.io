                <div class="risklens-section">
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>RiskLens is a chatbot built on a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture to automate 10-K analysis. It retrieves evidence directly from SEC filings, computes KPIs from XBRL data, and returns cited answers that are faster and more reliable than manual review or general-purpose AI.</p>
                    <p>The system is designed to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved 10-K text and reproducible KPI calculations, while improving speed, accuracy, and consistency across companies and years.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="risklens-section">
                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>10-K analysis is slow, manual, and inconsistent.</p>
                    <p>Analysts often spend hours:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Searching dense filings to find relevant risk disclosures</li>
                        <li>Comparing Item 1A risk language year over year</li>
                        <li>Extracting and calculating KPIs from XBRL tables manually</li>
                        <li>Writing summaries without a clean audit trail back to the source text</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This creates delays, increases cost, and makes it hard to scale across multiple companies and periods.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="risklens-section">
                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>RiskLens combines two ideas into a single workflow:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>RAG for grounded risk analysis</strong> - Instead of relying on the model's memory, RiskLens retrieves the most relevant Item 1A passages from a curated, year-aligned corpus and uses those passages as the evidence for the answer. This produces verifiable, cited outputs and reduces hallucinations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Structured KPI computation from XBRL</strong> - KPIs are computed directly from SEC XBRL data stored locally. The model does not "guess" numbers. It summarizes results that come from reproducible calculations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The result is a chatbot that can answer risk and KPI questions in plain English, with citations back to the filing text and consistent KPI definitions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="risklens-section">
                    <h2>What RiskLens Does</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Answers analyst questions using a RAG-based retrieval workflow grounded in SEC filings</li>
                        <li>Returns audit-ready citations that link insights back to 10-K evidence</li>
                        <li>Detects year-over-year changes in Item 1A risk disclosures</li>
                        <li>Computes financial KPIs directly from SEC XBRL to ensure numeric consistency</li>
                        <li>Produces plain-English summaries and visuals for faster review</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="risklens-section">
                    <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
                    <p>RiskLens is a RAG chatbot with a smart router and two specialized engines.</p>
                    <p>When a user asks a question, the router classifies intent and routes the request to one of the following:</p>
                    <img class="risklens-arch-image" src="architect.png" alt="RiskLens architecture diagram">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Risk engine (RAG + YOY)</strong> - Retrieves top-matching Item 1A passages from a year-aligned risk corpus, identifies year-over-year changes, and sends evidence to the LLM for a cited summary.</li>
                        <li><strong>KPI engine (structured data)</strong> - Queries locally stored KPI tables derived from SEC XBRL data, computes trends and comparisons, and returns reproducible numeric results.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The LLM is used only as a synthesis layer. It combines retrieved evidence and computed KPIs to generate answers and visuals, with citations that trace back to the original filings.</p>
                    <p>This design reduces hallucinations, improves accuracy, and returns answers in seconds.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="risklens-section">
                    <h2>Pilot and Validation</h2>
                    <p>RiskLens was piloted using 10-K filings from four large-cap US pharmaceutical companies across four fiscal years.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>16 analyst-style test cases covering risk, KPI, and hybrid questions</li>
                        <li>Overall accuracy of approximately 94 percent</li>
                        <li>Each query completed in seconds, enabling rapid review and comparison</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The pilot showed strong performance in retrieving the correct Item 1A evidence, detecting meaningful year-over-year changes, and producing KPI outputs consistent with XBRL-based calculations.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="risklens-section">
                    <h2>Impact</h2>
                    <p>Based on analyst interviews and pilot results:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Manual 10-K review time reduced from roughly 2 hours per day to 30 minutes</li>
                        <li>Approximately 390 analyst hours saved per year</li>
                        <li>Estimated productivity gain of about $28,000 per analyst annually</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The time saved shifts effort away from searching and copy-pasting toward higher-value analysis such as modeling, valuation, and deeper risk assessment.</p>
